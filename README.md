TASK1: Predict the Prices of different sports cars from various manufacturers using machine learning algorithms. The accuracy should be more than 80%. The dataset link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/sports-car-prices-dataset

TASK2: You are given a dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) where you need to predict whether a person will have heart disease or not. Use various Machine learningalgorithms and the accuracy should be more than 80%.

TASK3: Make a Artificial Neural network model of deep learning to predict the weather condition (summary) from the weather history dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muthuj7/weather-dataset

TASK4: Use transfer learning concept of Convolution neural network CNN to prepare a German traffic sign detection model. The total model should be implemented in a website through flask. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

TASK5: Prepare a English to French translation website where user will give English language and Frenchtranslation will be produced. Thistranslation website should be created by training the dataset from scratch and no api should be used to create the model. Use the concept of Natural Language Processing NLP, transformers,etc. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/en-fr-translation-dataset
